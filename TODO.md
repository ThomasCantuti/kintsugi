# TODO (Sunday 2026-10-11, hacking 10:30–17:00)

`[you]` = only Thomas can do it. Everything else is Claude's. Check items off as they land.
Scope and timeline: PLAN.md §8–9. **No project code before 10:30.**

## Before 10:30
- [ ] [you] Atlas **Sandbox** (email invite) → then run `! atlas auth login` here; I'll create the DB user, access list, URI and indexes with the Atlas CLI
- [ ] [you] Voyage AI key (free) as fallback if Atlas automated embedding isn't on the Sandbox → `VOYAGE_API_KEY`
- [ ] [you] Telegram: @BotFather `/newbot` → `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`; @userinfobot → `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID`
- [ ] [you] OpenRouter key → `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (free to start; $5 decision at ~11:45, PLAN.md §3)
- [ ] [you] NVIDIA API key if you have one from the other hackathon → `LLM_BASE_URL` option
- [ ] [you] Edit the conventions in PLAN.md §5 to your real ones (they become the hand-written cases)
- [ ] [you] Second Telegram account for the stranger, if you can get one
- [ ] [you] Discord #rules
- [ ] [you] Ask the Modelence team: Python process with a custom start command? external Atlas URI? what do the $50 credits cover?

## 10:30–10:45 Setup
- [x] [you] Create the **public** GitHub repo; first commit = planning docs
- [x] `uv init`, deps (openai, fastapi, uvicorn, pymongo, python-telegram-bot, pytest), `config.py`, `db.py` → Sandbox ping
- [ ] Spike: automated embedding index + one `$vectorSearch` with `query.text` (else Voyage client-side)

## 10:45–11:45 Runtime
- [x] `models.py`: chat via `openai` SDK, base URL from config, fallback chain, cost meter; `ScriptedModel`; every repair/fallback logged (wrangling counters)
- [x] Harness switches (`repair`, `fallback`, `guardrails`, `genome`, `retrieval`) so A0 = all off
- [x] `tools.py`: 8 Atlas tools, `world`-scoped, risk levels
- [x] `agent.py`: genome → prompt with top-k lessons via `$vectorSearch`, tool_access filter, guardrail check before writes, tool-call repair
- [x] `telegram.py` + `main.py`: owner/stranger tiers, episodes saved
- [x] (subagent) `evals/cases.json` drafts from PLAN.md §5 conventions → [you] edit by hand
- [x] (subagent) Tsugi SVG + `web/index.html`
- [ ] ✅ Check: Tsugi creates a calendar event in Atlas from Telegram

## 11:45–12:45 Evals + learning
- [x] `evals.py`: seed world, run case, DB-state checks, results → `runs`
- [ ] Freeze held-out: commit hash → MEMORY.md
- [ ] Baseline **A0** (raw loop) and **A** (Nemotron v0) on held-out → MEMORY.md Numbers
- [x] Failure dedup via `$vectorSearch` on failures/lessons → lineage parents
- [x] `learner.py`: supervisor `critique(episode, genome) -> {passed, critique, correction}` + `propose(failure)` ≤3 delta lessons; quarantine on stranger-only source
- [ ] Supervisor agreement vs ground-truth checks on all cases → MEMORY.md Numbers
- [x] `gate.py`: failing case + train + held-out, accept iff fixed and no regression
- [x] `tests/`: repair, gate accept/reject, held-out isolation, revoke, quarantine (ScriptedModel)
- [ ] [you] $5 decision

## 12:45–13:15 Lunch
- [ ] Evolution run on train in the background

## 13:15–14:15 Commit + trust
- [x] Commit txn (genome + lesson + lineage) → change stream → hot-swap
- [x] Revoke via `$graphLookup`; quarantine ✅/❌ buttons
- [x] `api.py`: SSE, `/revoke/{id}`, `/chat?tier=stranger`
- [ ] ✅ Check: live teach works end to end on Telegram

## 14:15–15:15 Proof
- [ ] Bars A0 (raw loop), B, C, D + curve from stored runs (2 trials)
- [ ] Wrangling counters from traces: repairs, fallbacks, guardrail blocks, $/task, latency
- [ ] Red-team cases (stranger attacks) → quarantine/blocked counts
- [ ] Live view: Tsugi seams/sprout/crack, chart

## 15:15–15:45 BOOST (only if everything above is green)
- [ ] RSI improver playbook · genome transfer to another model · deploy on Modelence (if Python works) · Exa search · reminder heartbeat · `red-team` agent pass

## 15:45–17:00 Ship
- [ ] Freeze numbers → MEMORY.md "Numbers"
- [ ] Rehearse 2× with a timer (`judge-panel` after the first)
- [ ] 1-min video (PLAN.md §7)
- [ ] README: what it does, numbers, how to run, "planning before the event, code during it"
- [ ] [you] Submit form + video + repo link before 17:00

## LATER (only if time is left)
- [ ] Brain MCP server · Gmail/Calendar · verifier + cascade · episode recall · goals · subagents · voice · τ²-bench
